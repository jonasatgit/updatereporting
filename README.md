1. Fixed a sub-report link problem for WSUS error and install error list

## 2022-04-04 v3.7:
1. Added parameter to show data based on current or previous month. The previous month setting is only applicable if updates are deployed with a month delay and does not rely on historical data
1. Changed the way compliance for update rollups are shown between first day of month and second Tuesday based on: https://github.com/jonasatgit/updatereporting/pull/11
1. Changed the "exclude future deployments" parameter to be able to filter out deployments in one of the following states: Deployed as available, deployment disabled, start time or deadline in the future
1. Changed the column "Missing updated approved" to only show missing updates if the corresponding deployment has not been filtered out via the new exclude parameter. The "per device" report still shows all updates no matter the deployment selection

1. Added cumulative update prefix like "2022-04" to the dashboard for each rollup bar graph

## 2021-07-02 v3.5:
